Ensure a seperation between the tile grid and the logic of the buildings
	Any area of effect building feature should use a radius or box based area

Consider making power requirements dependent on local weather conditions

Add throughput restraints to various sorts of connector
-Terrain is the worst, unable to support all traffic and worsens with roughness level
-Dozed terrain much better for raw resource transport
-Roads better still, and able to handle all traffic
-Tubes good at carrying people, but fine for processed goods, weak for ores
-Rail great at everything
-The average building is like a tube, but somewhat worse
-Unconnected buildings act like dozed terrain

Design layout of a colony:
	Colony
		BuildingGroups
		  -Connected by BuildingConnections
			Buildings

A colony is a set of interconnected BuildingGroups.  
Colony has:
	Shared construction resources out to a certain range


Construction:
	Starting a new construction sets down a construction building
	Building contains name of end result building and may cover multiple tiles
	Builds up resources; when needs are met decreases turns until complete timer by 1
	If underserved it will give some visible warning
	Player will have some means of prioritizing some constructions over others and
	  prioritizing a construction over colony maintainance needs
