How to determine buildable tiles?
	Discard all unresearched/otherwise locked buildings
	Check colony inventory for currently available resources not earmarked for maintainence
	Some buildings have odd requirements, such as dozed tiles needing a bulldozer and an open
	  robot command slot

Buildable Tile list:
	Rebuild list after each turn and each construction placement
		Hooks of some sort for those events
