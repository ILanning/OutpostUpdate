### Build Process

*Note: This project has only been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10, with builds done via Visual Studio 2015.  The assets in the asset pack are ripped from the original game.  The game is very much abandonware, but be aware.*

To build this yourself:

* Download and install [Monogame 3.6](http://www.monogame.net/2017/03/01/monogame-3-6/).
* Use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ILanning/OutpostUpdate.git` to pull the project and its submodule.
* Download the image asset pack [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3Yb36HM_ZN9cWdhU3VjYmFHZGs), then unzip its contents into the existing Outpost/Content directory.
* At this point, the project should be usable!
